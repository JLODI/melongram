Users can sign up for an account, fill in their profile, edit their profile and delete their account.<br>
Must be signed in to access app<br>
Users can submit a post with up to 20 images and one description<br>
Users can view posts, edit the description and delete their own posts<br>
Users can like and comment on posts and reply to comments (nested comments)<br>
Users can edit and delete their own posts<br>
Users can view other user profiles and all posts by that user<br>
